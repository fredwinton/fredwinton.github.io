   By the mid-19th century, pioneers used these trails to cross the mountains to reach the fertile Willamette Valley. The river, impounded by two artificial storage reservoirs as well as the lake, has been the primary source of drinking water for the city of Portland, Oregon, since 1895. Despite legal protections, about 22 percent of the protected zone was logged during the second half of the 20th century, and erosion increased, forcing Portland to shut down the water supply from the river one time in 1996

	Iron Maiden are an English heavy metal band formed in Leyton, east London, in 1975 by bassist and primary songwriter Steve Harris. The band's discography has grown to thirty-seven albums, including fifteen studio albums, eleven live albums, four EPs, and seven compilations.

	Steve Harris, Dave Murray and Doug Sampson spent the summer and autumn of 1978 rehearsing while they searched for a singer to complete the band's new line-up.[16] A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in Leytonstone in November 1978 evolved into a successful audition for vocalist Paul Di'Anno.[17] Steve Harris has stated, "There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, or whatever you want to call it, that just gave it this great edge."[18] At this time, Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting, "Davey was so good he could do a lot of it on his own. The plan was always to get a second guitarist in, but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult

	On New Year's Eve 1978, Iron Maiden recorded a demo, consisting of four songs, at Spaceward Studios in Cambridge.[20] Hoping the recording would help them secure more gigs,[20] the band presented a copy to Neal Kay, then managing a heavy metal club called "Bandwagon Heavy Metal Soundhouse", located in Kingsbury Circle, northwest London.[21] Upon hearing the tape, Kay began playing the demo regularly at the Bandwagon, and one of the songs, "Prowler", eventually went to No. 1 in the Soundhouse charts, which were published weekly in Sounds magazine.[22] A copy was also acquired by Rod Smallwood, who soon became the band's manager,[23] and, as Iron Maiden's popularity increased, they decided to release the demo on their own record label as The Soundhouse Tapes, named after the club.[24] Featuring only three tracks (one song, "Strange World", was excluded as the band were unsatisfied with its production)[25] all five thousand copies were sold out within weeks.

	In December 1979, the band secured a major record deal with EMI[27] and asked Dave Murray's childhood friend Adrian Smith to join the group as their second guitarist.[28] Smith declined as he was busy with his own band, Urchin, so Iron Maiden hired guitarist Dennis Stratton instead.[29] Shortly afterwards, Doug Sampson left due to health issues and was replaced by ex-Samson drummer Clive Burr at Stratton's suggestion on 26 December.[30] Iron Maiden's first appearance on an album was on the Metal for Muthas compilation (released on 15 February 1980) with two early versions of "Sanctuary" and "Wrathchild".[31] The release led to an ensuing tour which featured several other bands linked with the New Wave of British Heavy Metal

	The tour following the album, dubbed the World Slavery Tour, was the band's largest to date and consisted of 193 shows in 28 countries over 13 months,[59] playing to an estimated 3,500,000 people.[60] Many shows were played back-to-back in the same city, such as in Long Beach, California, where the band played four consecutive concerts. It was here where the majority of their subsequent live release, Live After Death, was recorded, which became a critical and commercial success, peaking at No. 4 in the UK.[61] Iron Maiden also made their debut appearance in South America, where they co-headlined (with Queen) the Rock in Rio festival to an estimated crowd of 300,000.[62] The tour was physically gruelling for the band, who demanded six months off when it ended (although this was later reduced to four months)
